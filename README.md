Twitter Sentiment Analysis is about classifying whether it is a positive or negative tweet based on the given dataset. The prediction of these 2 classes is done by ML model. I used 4 models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest. Based on the predictions done by the model I came to a conclusion that Logistion Regression works better than the other models.
I took a small sample from the dataset because the dataset is too large and its difficult to process such a large dataset in my machine.
Since the dataset is too large I will attach the google drive link here:
